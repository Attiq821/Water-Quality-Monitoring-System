Title: Uploading DHT11 sensor data on ThingSpeak using Wemos D1 R1 

Explanation:
	
--> First we must have required components
	(1)Wemos D1 R2 Mini
	(2)DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
	(3)BreadBorad (optional)
	(4)Jumper Wires	

--> Make the circuit diagram shown in the diagram attached file

--> Connect the WeMOS to the internet i.e using Hotspot of your mobile 

--> Upload the Code provided in the arduino attached file.

--> Connect your WeMOS with ThingSpeak using apiWritekey to write the sensor data that is done in the code part already

--> Upload the code

--> Analyze the result
